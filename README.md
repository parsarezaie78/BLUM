> Selling this tool in any form is strictly prohibited!

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide

> Requires NodeJS to be installed

- Step 1: Download the latest version of the tool [here ‚¨áÔ∏è](https://github.com/zuydd/blum/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
- Step 2: Extract the tool
- Step 3: In the extracted folder (the folder containing the `package.json` file), run the command `npm install` to install the necessary libraries

## üíæ How to Add Account Data

> The tool supports both `user` and `query_id`

> All the data you need to enter is located in the files within the üìÅ `src / data` folder

- [users.txt](src/data/users.txt): contains the list of `users` or `query_id` for each account, one account per line
- [proxy.txt](src/data/proxy.txt): contains the list of proxies, where each proxy corresponds to an account in the `users.txt` file. Leave blank if no proxy is needed
- [token.json](src/data/token.json): contains the list of tokens generated from `user` or `query_id`. Tokens will be automatically generated when you run the tool

> Proxy format: http://user:pass@ip:port

## üïπÔ∏è Features of the Tool

- Automatic daily check-in
- Automatically join tribes for an extra 10% bonus points
- Automatic task completion
- Automatically farm/claim rewards at the right time
- Automatic gameplay
- Claim invite points
- Automatically detect proxies and reconnect when there's an error. Add proxies to `proxy.txt` corresponding to the account, leave blank or write "skip" if no proxy is needed
- Multi-threaded: run as many accounts as you like without blocking each other
- Configure game playtime: by default, the tool always plays the game, but you can skip peak hours by setting the `TIME_PLAY_GAME = []` variable, e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 8, 20]` to skip gameplay during those hours

> [!WARNING]  
> - If you encounter login or task issues, it's likely the Blum server's fault, not the tool's. Just wait until the server is back online.
> - Blum servers often fail between 2 PM to 12 AM, so it‚Äôs recommended to run the tool for the first time between 4 AM and 12 PM for smoother operation.

## ‚ôæ Multi-Threading Setup

- By default, the tool will run multiple threads corresponding to the number of accounts entered, no further setup is required.
- In the first loop, each account (thread) will start 30 seconds apart to avoid request spamming. You can adjust this delay by modifying the `DELAY_ACC = 10` variable in the [index.js](src/run/index.js) file.

## ‚ùå Retry Mode on Errors

- For proxy connection errors, the system will retry every 30 seconds. You can set the retry limit by adjusting the `MAX_RETRY_PROXY = 20` variable in the [index.js](src/run/index.js) file (default is 20). If the retry limit is reached, the system will stop auto-running that account and log the error in [log.error.txt](src/data/log.error.txt).
- For login failures, the system retries every 60 seconds. Adjust the retry limit with the `MAX_RETRY_LOGIN = 20` variable in the [index.js](src/run/index.js) file (default is 20). Errors will be logged in [log.error.txt](src/data/log.error.txt) after too many retries.
